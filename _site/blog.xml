<p>At 39 North Labs, we strive to be at the forefront of data-driven insights, focusing on spatial analysis and GIS. We’re thrilled to announce the latest addition to our team, <a href="../../steven-frato.html">Steven Frato</a>, a dedicated Data Analyst Intern with a passion for public health and spatial data.</p>
<p>Steven is currently working towards his Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry at <a href="https://stockton.edu">Stockton University.</a> His academic grounding, coupled with an enthusiasm for data-driven solutions, makes him a fantastic addition to our team.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mapping-new-jerseys-healthcare-accessibility-an-early-preview">Mapping New Jersey’s Healthcare Accessibility: An Early Preview</h2>
<p>Steven is undertaking an ambitious research project as part of his internship: a spatial analysis of New Jersey hospitals focusing on healthcare accessibility and social determinants of health. This analysis, conducted at the census tract level, aims to assess the extent to which residents of New Jersey can access hospital care. A census tract is a geographic region defined for the purpose of taking a census. It generally includes around 4,000 residents but can range from 1,200 to 8,000.</p>
<p>For this early phase of the project, Steven has fused New Jersey’s state hospital licensing dataset with data from the U.S. Census Bureau to create a tract-level dataset suitable for small-area analysis. This data was used to match each census tract with its nearest hospital and calculate the distance between them.</p>
<p>The preliminary findings reveal that all New Jersey residents live within 17 miles of a licensed hospital, although some areas have better coverage than others. These findings can be explored in the interactive map included in this post.</p>

<p>In the next stage of the project, Steven will evaluate hospital capacity, transit, and drive accessibility using a routing engine as well as additional spatial analysis. This will offer a more comprehensive analysis of healthcare accessibility in the state.</p>
<p>The project aims to evaluate the extent to which New Jersey residents can access hospital care, considering various factors such as road congestion and public transit availability. By blending various state data sources and using open-source packages for the R programming language (including our sponsored package, <a href="../../open-source.html">njgeo</a>), Steven’s analysis will shed light on critical healthcare accessibility issues facing New Jersey residents and will be of interest to planning &amp; public policy professionals.</p>
