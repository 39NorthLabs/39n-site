## Providing Data Science Thought Leadership

39 North Labs maintains several open-source packages to assist with data science workflows, with a focus on the R & Python programming languages.

While these packages are free and open for anyone to use, professional support for implementing them is available through our [professional services](/services.qmd) practice.

## R Packages

### njtr1
njtr1 enables road safety research by providing an easy R interface for programatically obtaining geotagged motor vehicle accident data for analysis purposes.
